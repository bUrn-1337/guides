# Getting Started with Web Exploitation

Web exploitation is a core category in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions and real-world security testing.  
This guide will walk you through the basics, common vulnerabilities, and essential tools to help you get started.

---

## üåê What is Web Exploitation?
Web exploitation involves finding and leveraging vulnerabilities in web applications.  
The goal is usually to **gain unauthorized access, extract hidden data, or bypass protections**.

## How to get Started
Before diving in, make sure you are comfortable with:
- Watch CS50's lectuce 6, 7, 8, 9 and complete the assignments to get a basic knowledge of web 
- Understanding of **HTTP (requests, responses, headers, cookies)** refer: [TOP's lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-how-does-the-web-work)
- Using a browser‚Äôs **developer tools** 
- Complete [Linux Luminarium](https://pwn.college/linux-luminarium/) to get comfortable with the terminal (linux or macos)
- Start solving challenges on [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/practice)
- Explore vulnerabilites on [Portswigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths), start with xss, sqli, file upload vulnerabilites,authentication vulnerabilites and gradually dig deeper into those topics.
- Give beginner level CTFs from [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/)
- Read writeups for CTFs and read bug bounty reports.

## üîé Common Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Information Disclosure**
- Hidden files (`robots.txt`, `.git/`, `.env`)
- Misconfigured error messages
- Directory traversal (`../../etc/passwd`)

### 2. **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
- Example payload: `' OR '1'='1`
- Tools: `sqlmap`

### 3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- Injecting malicious JavaScript
- Example: `<script>alert(1)</script>`
- Used to steal cookies or perform actions on behalf of a victim
- Amazing resource: [text](https://aszx87410.github.io/beyond-xss/en/)

### 4. **Command Injection**
- Input directly executed on the server
- Example: user input directly appended to os command like `curl user_input`

### 5. **Authentication Bypasses**
- Default credentials
- Insecure session handling
- JWT vulnerabilities

## ‚öíÔ∏è Essential Tools
- **Burp Suite / OWASP ZAP** ‚Äì Intercept & manipulate requests
- **cURL / Postman** ‚Äì Quick API testing
- **sqlmap** ‚Äì Automated SQLi exploitation
- **gobuster / dirsearch** ‚Äì Directory brute-forcing
- **Browser DevTools** ‚Äì Inspect & manipulate frontend code

---

## üöÄ Methodology
1. **Reconnaissance** ‚Äì Look for endpoints, parameters, hidden files, sinks where user input is going.
2. **Input Testing** ‚Äì Look at the source code, try to find where input is going and try payloads related to the sink
3. **Manipulate Requests** ‚Äì Modify headers, cookies, and payloads.
4. **Identify Vulnerabilities** ‚Äì See how the application responds.
5. **Exploit & Extract** ‚Äì Use tools or manual techniques to retrieve sensitive data.

## ‚úÖ Tips for Beginners
- Always start with **manual testing** before automated tools.
- Learn to read error messages carefully.
- Keep practicing on CTF platforms.
- Google more than you chatgpt, as you get more advanced, google will always be the one to come in clutch, not chatgpt.
